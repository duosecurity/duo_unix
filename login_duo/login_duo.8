.Sh NAME
.Nm login_duo
.Nd second-factor authentication via Duo login service
.Sh SYNOPSIS
login_duo
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl c Ar file
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl f Ar user
.Op Ar command Op Ar args...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides secondary authentication via the Duo authentication service,
executing the user's login shell or command only if successful.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm failmode"
.It Fl c
Specify an alternate configuration file to load. Default is
.Pa /etc/duo/login_duo.conf
.It Fl d
Debug mode; send logs to stderr instead of syslog.
.It Fl h
Specify the remote IP address for this login (normally 
taken from the
.Ev SSH_CONNECTION
environment variable, if set).
.It Fl f
Specify an alternate Duo user to authenticate as.
.El
.Pp
If 
.Nm
is installed setuid root (the default), these options are
only available to the super-user.
.Pp
After successful Duo authentication, the user's login shell is
invoked, or if an alternate
.Ar command
or
.Ev SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
environment variable is specified, it will be executed via the user's
shell with a \-c option.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The INI-format configuration file must have a
.Dq Li duo
section with the following options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm failmode"
.It Cm host
Duo API host (required).
.It Cm ikey
Duo integration key (required).
.It Cm skey
Duo secret key (required).
.It Cm groups
If specified, Duo authentication is required only for users whose
primary group or supplementary group list matches one of the
space-separated 
.Em pattern-lists
(see
.Sx PATTERNS
below).
.It Cm failmode
On service or configuration errors that prevent Duo authentication, fail
.Dq Li safe
(allow access) or
.Dq Li secure
(deny access). Default is
.Dq Li safe .
.It Cm pushinfo
Send command to be approved via Duo Push authentication. Default is
.Dq Li no .
.It Cm http_proxy
Use the specified HTTP proxy, same format as the HTTP_PROXY environment
variable.
.It Cm autopush
Upon successful first-factor authentication, automatically send a login request to the primary second-factor (usually Duo Push). Can be
.Dq Li yes
or
.Dq Li no .
Default is 
.Dq Li no .
.It Cm motd
Print the contents of 
.Pa /etc/motd
to screen after a successful login. Either "yes" or "no."
Default is "no".
.It Cm prompts
Number of login attempts a user gets. Default is 3. If using autopush, it is recommended to set prompts to 1.
.It Cm accept_env_factor
Look for factor selection or passcode in the DUO_PASSCODE environment variable,
before prompting the user. Can override autopush. Default is "no".
.It Cm fallback_local_ip
If unable to determine the authentication users's IP address, fallback on the
IP address of the server. Default is "no".
.It Cm https_timeout
Set to the number of seconds to wait for HTTPS responses from Duo Security. If Duo Security takes longer than the configured number of seconds to respond to the preauth API call, the configured failmode is triggered. Other network operations such as DNS resolution, TCP connection establishment, and the SSL handshake have their own independent timeout and retry logic. Default is 0, which disables the HTTPS timeout.
.El
.Pp
An example configuration file:
.Bd -literal -offset 8n
[duo]
host = api-deadbeef.duosecurity.com
ikey = SI9F...53RI
skey = 4MjR...Q2NmRiM2Q1Y
pushinfo = yes
autopush = yes
.Ed
.Pp
If installed setuid root (the default), 
.Nm
performs Duo authentication as a dedicated privilege separation user,
requiring that the configuration file be owned and readable only by
this user.
.Sh PATTERNS
A
.Em pattern
consists of zero or more non-whitespace characters,
.Sq *
(a wildcard that matches zero or more characters),
or
.Sq ?\&
(a wildcard that matches exactly one character).
.Pp
A 
.Em pattern-list
is a comma-separated list of patterns. Patterns within pattern-lists
may be negated by preceding them with an exclamation mark
.Pq Sq !\& .
For example, to specify Duo authentication for all users (except those
that are also admins), and for guests:
.Pp
.Dl groups = users,!wheel,!*admin guests
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
can be enabled system-wide by specifying its full path as a
.Cm ForceCommand 
in 
.Xr sshd_config 5
to capture any SSH remote login (including subsystems, remote
commands, and interactive login):
.Bd -literal -offset 8n
ForceCommand /usr/local/sbin/login_duo
.Ed
.Pp
Similarly, a group of administrators could require two-factor
authentication for login to a shared root account by specifying
.Nm
as the forced command for each public key in
.Pa ~root/.ssh/authorized_keys :
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset 8n
command="/usr/local/sbin/login_duo \-f alice"
ssh-rsa AAAAB2...19Q== alice@example.net
command="/usr/local/sbin/login_duo \-f bob"
ssh-dss AAAAC3...51R== bob@example.net
.Ed
.Pp
A user without root access could configure their own account to
require Duo authentication via the same
.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
forced command mechanism and a user-installed (non-setuid) 
.Nm .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm failmode"
.It Pa /etc/duo/login_duo.conf
Default configuration file path

.An "Duo Security" Aq support@duosecurity.com
.Sh NOTES
When used to protect remote SSH access, only interactive sessions
support interactive Duo login. For
.Xr scp 1 ,
.Xr sftp 1 ,
.Xr rsync 1 ,
and other
.Xr ssh 1
remote commands, 
.Nm
automatically tries the user's default out-of-band factor
(smartphone push or voice callback) and disables real-time login
progress reporting to provide a clean shell environment.
